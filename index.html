    </label>
     <p > The fact that our
    designer goods do not represent wealth for positive utility is having more
    negative damage to society than we can fathom. This article is going to help
    detail why, and detail our solution in progress. </p>
     <p>
         As individuals,
    once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an intrinsic motivator in the
    rest of our actions. Status comes in many forms. The healthiest / most
    enlightened cultures put the highest status in rewarding positive sum
    behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become
    widespread as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the
    highest form of status. It has become such common Christmas list item for
    broke young teenagers that the richest man on the planet at the time of this
    writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods representing
    nothing more than the ability to waste money. Collectively this
    misrepresentation of true status (service to others) is attributing more
    damage to building a healthy positive culture than we can imagine.
 
    </p> <p> Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could
    be used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves and
    others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a false form of
    status as a service. Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was
    considered cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the
    capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species. Imagine a
    world where the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot of money
    to make a lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far
    as to redistribute the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper
    cultural effects this new alignment would have. </p>
     <p class="underp"> “Over the past
    hundred years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold, yet wealth
    inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows rapidly. In
    order to change the failure of redistribution of wealth at scale, we must
    effectively influence culture and help redefine what “status” is in the
    modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of money in society as the
    new age of status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have
    failed at building a society which healthily distributes wealth/power. Given
    society is a collective project we are responsible for, we think this stems
    from the culture not supporting doing good as the highest form of status. We
    have more than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and
    a culture that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.”

     <p> On a fundamental level once
        someone gets the basics covered as in food, water, shelter. They can start
        to spend their time and money on convenience, health, and purpose but more
        often than not; status is where a majority of surplus wealth goes.
   
  </p> <p> Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating a
  better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural
  see as status has been referred to as “Status Engineering”.
   
  </p>
  <p>
  
      What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves and our
      ideals/values. What your role model wears, or any person of influence is
      shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or adults mind. </p>
       <p>
          <b>
              Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra for a
              certain brand of T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.
          </b>
     
   
  </p> <p> The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an
  individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in society and a tool
  for respect attribution. That’s why you see Dior shoes in economy. This is not a
  miscalculation, currently the status from spending $1100 on shoes does have more
  long term value than things like first class because we are playing the game of
  unenlightened capitalism. </p> <p> The problem is that we support the status
  symbol which costs $1100 and does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is
  not a failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do
  not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in
  Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent structure for someone for
  this amount). We need higher forms of status to exist in order to progress our
  culture which will aid in the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic
  level. </p> <p> Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely
  financial status seems become recognized for their tackiness and buying status
  will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently, we idolize
  symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we are, the clothing we
  wear, we display 0 creativity or care for the world in spending and instead
  promote wasting wealth for the sake of power/leverage over others, and then we
  wonder why society is misaligned to building a healthy world. Fashion, what we
  wear, is the biggest signal we have in representing our identity and values.
  </p> <p> If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we can
  not only change the money used to buy status into doing good for the world, but
  we can change our core representation of status in society towards doing good.
  </p> <p> While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real impact
  in realigning our culture towards true status, the amount of funds in status
  spending that could be redirected towards positive causes is also no joke.

    billion in 2020 to USD 352.84 billion in 2027</label>  </p> 
  
  <p class="underp"> The Luxury Cars Market

      Aligning status culturally on a global scale means reattributing that wealth
      towards benefit for humanity and shifting the entire global view of wealth.

    <p> <b>
        Thought experiments make it obvious
        that this idea is memetic, and just has not been tried in the market. Once
        one initial company opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:
    </b>
        </p>
         <p> For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can
        be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the idea
        that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased an item, they
        are having to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly).
        </p> <p> Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can
        extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling someone
        not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really want to win this
        war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same price. </p>
    
        <p> Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors
        outside of a designer store. Rather than simply protesting their spending on
        that good, we need to sell them a better version of what they are buying.
        </p>
         <p> Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up
        showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a great way to
        connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater divide in
        mindsets. </p>
        
        <p> In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury goods
        markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo drive for example is a
        notorious spot where every designer store not only has a shop, but theres a
        steady flow of customers. </p> 
        <p> Social media accounts devoted to making
        content here are already massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of
        views interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a
        viral video and an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers
        while kickstarting educating the world of the low status of wasteful
        spending now that a better alternative exists. </p>
